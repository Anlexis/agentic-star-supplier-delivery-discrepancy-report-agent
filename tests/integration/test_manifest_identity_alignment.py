# The identity the entrypoint provisions secrets under, against the identity the
# manifest declares.
#
# The manifest is the source of truth for who this agent is. The secret provider
# is scoped by that identity: it reads `env/namespaces/{namespace}/.env.{env}`
# and `env/agents/{namespace}/{agent_name}/.env.{env}`. Under the registry the
# scope comes from `config/agent.yaml`; standalone it comes from whatever
# `src/api/server.py` passes to the factory. When those two disagree, one
# agent's secrets live in two stores and a key provisioned for the registry
# deployment is simply absent in the standalone one — with no error at boot,
# because a missing tier file is ignored by design. Nothing fails until a secret
# is declared, and then it fails in only one of the two deployments.
#
# Both sides are READ here, never restated: the manifest is parsed from
# config/agent.yaml, and the entrypoint's identity is taken from the provider
# the module actually provisioned on the agent. A test that spelled the expected
# namespace out twice would keep passing through exactly the drift it exists to
# catch.
#
# The direction of the alignment is pinned too. `namespace:` is
# `lower(industry_code)` — the manifest's own `industry` field, lowercased. Both
# facts are checked, so re-aligning the wrong way (moving the manifest onto the
# entrypoint's value instead of the reverse) fails here rather than passing as a
# fix.
#
# Deterministic — no model, no network, no filesystem beyond the manifest.
